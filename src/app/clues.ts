The argument was about the victim's involvement in a secret project that Colonel Yellow was overseeing. The project was to develop a new type of weapon that could be used to incapacitate an enemy without causing any physical harm. The victim was concerned that the weapon could be used for nefarious purposes. Colonel Yellow was insistent that the weapon was safe and that the victim was overreacting. The argument ended with the victim storming out of the hotel.",
